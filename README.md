As we'd like to stray away from a specific programming language, we've chosen to use the Kaitai file schema.
It has a [very user friendly IDE](https://ide.kaitai.io/) and generates parsers for almost every programming language.

If you feel like a file structure is better represented with another language (Protobufs, Flatbuffers), please note it in the relevant READMEs.
