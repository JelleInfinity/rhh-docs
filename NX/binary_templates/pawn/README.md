## Pawn Machine (AMX)

Currently research is halted as the files are compressed past the tagAMXHeader class. Once a sample python/c script is provided for decompression, the tagAMX fields will be populated.



## Notes

In case you want to use Pawn's disassembler or compiler: GameFreak has five user fields, uses 64bit pointers and 64bit Cells, please set these accordingly.

The sc6 stage of the pawn compiler differs from the struct specification, will follow closely once decompressed to see which changes are necessary.
