# Personal Struct

Unofficial versioning as follows:
v1.0 LGPE

v1.1 SWSH/Home

v1.2 Isle of Armor update
v1.3 Crown Tundra update



Currently there's one unknown substructure, it's a 5x5 table spread over the bytes_n, shorts and quantized float fields.

# BSEQ (Battle Sequence)

These dictate move logic, which anims to load and whatnot.

Uses some sort of unknown bytecode, current .ksy is completely off but still worth a look as a good shot in the dark.
