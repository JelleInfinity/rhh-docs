# Flatbuffers

Since gflib3, Game Freak has adopted the ``flatbuffers`` library for serializing their files.

### Deserializing

In order to de-serialize, you can use one of the .ksy files provided in this repo and use the flatc tool available from Google's ``flatbuffer`` page.

### Reverse Engineering Flatbuffers

TODO: Explain this

Most flatbuffers follow a similar structure.

Root PTR > Node > Vtable > Object info......

### Notes

It is important to know that the flatbuffer compiler Game Freak used is ``flatcc`` which serializes in different ways from flatc:

* VTable rel-pointers (relative pointers) tend to be negative by default.
* VTable rel-pointers can be shared.
* Strings can be shared.

Flatc takes the na√Øve approach and does not offer these optimizations, for modding purposes this is not an inconvenience.
